# Anti-Overfitting Strategies

## Signs of Overfitting
- ✅ Training loss continues to decrease
- ❌ Validation loss starts increasing
- ❌ Large gap between training and validation loss
- ❌ Model performance degrades on unseen data

## Current Anti-Overfitting Settings
```python
hidden_channels=32,      # Smaller model (was 64)
num_layers=1,           # Shallow model (was 2)
feature_dropout=0.5,    # High dropout (was 0.3)
edge_dropout=0.3,       # Edge dropout (was 0.2)
final_dropout=0.4,      # Final dropout (was 0.2)
batch_size=64,          # Larger batches (was 32)
lr=3e-4,               # Lower learning rate (was 5e-4)
weight_decay=1e-3,      # Strong regularization (was 1e-4)
early_stopping=True,    # Stop when validation worsens
patience=8,            # Stop quickly (was 10)
lr_scheduler="plateau", # Reduce LR when plateauing
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Increase Regularization (Current)
```python
feature_dropout=0.6,    # Even more dropout
edge_dropout=0.4,       # More edge dropout
weight_decay=1e-2,      # Much stronger regularization
```

### Fix 2: Reduce Model Capacity
```python
hidden_channels=16,     # Much smaller model
num_layers=1,          # Keep shallow
feature_dropout=0.3,   # Moderate dropout
```

### Fix 3: Data Augmentation
```python
batch_size=128,        # Much larger batches
lr=1e-4,              # Very low learning rate
```

### Fix 4: Early Stopping with Monitoring
```python
early_stopping=True,
patience=5,           # Stop very quickly
# Monitor validation loss closely
```

## Monitoring During Training

### Good Signs
- Training and validation loss both decreasing
- Small gap between train/val loss
- Validation loss stabilizes around epoch 15-20

### Bad Signs
- Validation loss increases while training loss decreases
- Large gap between train/val loss (>0.2)
- Validation loss keeps increasing

## Quick Test Scripts

### Conservative Model (Try First)
```python
model, metrics, history = run_training(
    hidden_channels=16,
    num_layers=1,
    feature_dropout=0.6,
    edge_dropout=0.4,
    final_dropout=0.5,
    batch_size=128,
    lr=1e-4,
    weight_decay=1e-2,
    early_stopping=True,
    patience=5,
    lr_scheduler="plateau",
    lr_gamma=0.2,
    epochs=30,
)
```

### Moderate Regularization
```python
model, metrics, history = run_training(
    hidden_channels=32,
    num_layers=1,
    feature_dropout=0.5,
    edge_dropout=0.3,
    final_dropout=0.4,
    batch_size=64,
    lr=3e-4,
    weight_decay=1e-3,
    early_stopping=True,
    patience=8,
    lr_scheduler="plateau",
    lr_gamma=0.3,
    epochs=30,
)
```

## What to Do Next

1. **Run the current settings** - they should prevent overfitting
2. **If still overfitting**: Try the "Conservative Model" settings
3. **If underfitting**: Gradually increase model capacity
4. **Monitor the gap** between training and validation loss

## Key Principles

1. **Start small**: Use smaller models and increase gradually
2. **Regularize heavily**: Dropout, weight decay, early stopping
3. **Monitor closely**: Watch for validation loss increases
4. **Stop early**: Don't let overfitting continue
5. **Use larger batches**: Better gradient estimates
